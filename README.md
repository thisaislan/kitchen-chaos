Every now and then I have some time in my hands and as a totally normal developer I think, what kind of program can I make to kill that time? The only correct answer is `A Game` :heart_eyes:

## Kitchen Chaos

Browsing on Youtube I saw that [free complete Course - Unity Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg) by [Code Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMonkeyUnity) and I thought "that guy has been working with Unity for more than ten years now, I am sure I can learn something!" and, Oh boy, I was so right. I learned a ton with that project.

The course is free and is very nice to anyone who wants know a little more about Unity and its technology. Another important point about the course is that it is divided in two parts, the [Learn Unity Beginner/Intermediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg) and [Learn Unity Multiplayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7glCsF9fv3s), so you will have a lot of ground to cover.

Although I could do some things with a different approach, and I did, I tried stick with the Monkey's style, I am not sure if I did my best, but I am happy with the final result, and this is the most important :grin:

<br>

## The project

Feel free to download and run the project, you will need only to link the project with your account on Unity dashboard to activate Unity multiplayer and relay. You can see how to do this [here](https://youtu.be/7glCsF9fv3s?si=G7TChwVn-K9i6ooQ&t=16708) and [here](https://youtu.be/7glCsF9fv3s?si=AkIwUyWDx0eIl6n9&t=20309) respectively.
